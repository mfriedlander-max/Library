## Workflow (Required Skills)

This project uses the **superpowers** skill system. Skills are mandatory, not optional.

### Skill Invocation Rules
1. Check for applicable skills **before any action** (even clarifying questions)
2. If there's even a 1% chance a skill applies, invoke it
3. Process skills (brainstorming, debugging) come before implementation skills

### Phase → Skill Map

| Phase | Skill | When |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Start** | `using-superpowers` | Every task, first thing |
| **Design** | `brainstorming` | New features, unclear requirements |
| **Planning** | `writing-plans` | Before any implementation (writes to this file) |
| **Branch Setup** | `using-git-worktrees` | When creating feature branches |
| **Execution** | `subagent-driven-development` | Same-session parallel work |
| **Execution** | `executing-plans` | Separate-session with human checkpoints |
| **Parallel** | `dispatching-parallel-agents` | Independent tasks that can run concurrently |
| **Coding** | `test-driven-development` | **Always** - no code without failing test first |
| **Debugging** | `systematic-debugging` | Any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior |
| **Pre-completion** | `verification-before-completion` | Before claiming any work is done |
| **Branch Done** | `finishing-a-development-branch` | Ready to merge |
| **Review** | `requesting-code-review` | After major implementations |
| **Review** | `receiving-code-review` | When processing feedback |

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests:** Strict TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **E2E tests:** Verification gate before merge (Playwright MCP)

### Token Optimization
| Task Type | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Exploration/search | `Explore` subagent |
| Simple mechanical tasks | `model: "haiku"` |
| Implementation | Fresh agent per task |
| Complex reasoning | Full context (Sonnet/Opus) |

### Parallel Work Patterns
- **Pattern A (multiple branches):** Independent features → separate `feature/*` branches via worktrees
- **Pattern B (single branch):** One feature with sub-tasks → declare file ownership below, no overlap allowed

### Abandoned Branches
If a branch is abandoned (wrong approach, blocked, etc.):
1. Delete the branch
2. Log in AI_SCRATCHPAD.md: date, branch name, reason for abandonment, any lessons learned
